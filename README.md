![Simple calculator made with Vue](https://i.imgur.com/xJ8s8tQ.jpg)
 - My first project using Vue.
 - This project is made to implement what I have learnt about Vue.
 - About the calculator itself:
	 - It has basic functionality of a simple arithmetic calculator which is to add, subtract, multiply, and divide of a two given number.
	 - There are two output display: one for displaying current operation (top) and the other for displaying current number that user give input to (bottom). 
	 - As for styling I'm using CSS framework which is Tailwind CSS.
